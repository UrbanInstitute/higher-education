                <h2>Enrollment</h2>
                <p>Enrollment patterns play an important role in determining what prices students face as well as state funding. There is considerable variation across states in the percentage of out-of-state students enrolled, in the breakdown betwwen two-year and four-year institutions, and in enrollment growth over time.</p>

                <h3>Share of Public FTE Enrollments that are in a Two-Year School</h3>
                <p>Having low two-year tuition and fees is more significant in a state in which a larger proportion of students attend two-year institutions. Large states (i.e. CA, NY, TX, FL, and IL) tend to have high proportions of students in two-year institutions, driving the national average far above the proportion of enrollment in two-year institutions in most states.</p>

                <h3>Migration Across State Lines</h3>
                <p>In some states (colored dark blue) leaving the state to enroll in college is very unusual, but nearly half of college-going high school graduates enroll out-of-state in parts of New England (colored light blue). States do not have to fund education for those who leave the state, and most states do not provide state grant aid to these students.</p>
                <p>The same states where relatively few students remain in-state tend to have a larger proportion of public enrollments from out-of-state. While regional agreements do exist to lower out-of-state tuition for students from neighboring states, states with many out-of-state students at their public institutions (colored dark yellow) bring in more tuition revenue through higher out-of-state tuition and fees.

                <h3>Percentage Change in Enrollment since 2000-01</h3>
                <p>Rapid growth in postsecondary enrollment between fall 2000 and fall 2010 was a significant factor in declining per-student funding over this time period, with the Great Recession (shaded here from fall 2007 to fall 2011) accelerating the trend. Nationally, enrollment peaked in fall 2010 and has since declined in most states, but continued increasing in several others.</p>
                <p>Large southern states with dramatic increases in enrollment since fall 2000 have driven the national trend upward, while California and Illinois have grown more slowly and have put downward pressure on the national average rate of enrollment growth. States such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts on the east coast have followed the national trend, while many smaller states have experienced larger swings in enrollment (e.g. Louisiana, Oregon).
