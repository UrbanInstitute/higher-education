                <h2>Funding</h2>
                <p>Variation in tuition and fees and in enrollment across states is tightly intertwined with variation in state funding for higher education. Nationally, funding has declined on a per-student basis since the Great Recession—but patterns in funding and enrollment tell a different story for each state. In some states, overall funding has declined steeply, while in other states, the challenge has been keeping up with skyrocketing postsecondary enrollment. Greater funding declines are associated with steeper price increases in some states’ public institutions, but this correlation across states is far from perfect.</p>

                <h3>Funding per FTE student vs. Funding per $1,000 in Personal Income, 2014-15</h3>
                <p>Funding per full-time equivalent student varies widely across states (left axis). Some of this difference is related to differences in state wealth and in costs of living. Focusing on funding per $1,000 in average personal income in the state (right axis) accounts for some of the differences in available resources that affect the effort required to fund higher education.</p>
                <p>In very high-income states (e.g. Connecticut, New Jersey, New York), lower-than-average funding relative to personal income, or low funding effort, yields higher than average per-student funding. In others, above average funding per $1,000 in personal income, or high funding effort, yields below average funding per student (e.g. Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia).</p>

                <h3>State Grant Aid to Students: Need-Based vs. Non-Need-Based, 2013-14</h3>
                <p>State funding for higher education includes funding for student financial aid in addition to funding for institutional operations. Some states have generous grant programs, effectively lowering tuition for their recipients at whichever public in-state institution they attend. Others are almost exclusively focused on funding operating budgets, which reduces the tuition institutions must charge to cover ongoing costs.</p>
                <p>Among states where individual student aid is an important component of postsecondary education funding, some direct their grant aid towards students with limited ability to pay, while others subsidize students with strong academic credentials. In seven of the ten most generous states, less than half of the aid is distributed with consideration of students’ financial circumstances. New Jersey, New York, and Washington have particularly generous need-based programs.</p>
                <p>NOTE: New Hampshire does not give grant aid</p>

                <h3>Percentage Change in Total Funding since 2000-01</h3>
                <p>For the nation as a whole, total funding was about the same in 2014-15 as in 2000-01, after adjusting for inflation. But funding increased in 23 states and decreased in the rest over this 14-year period. The largest decline in funding was in 2011-12, when 44 states decreased their funding.</p>
                <p>Unpredictable fluctuations from year to year exacerbate the funding challenges facing public colleges. From 2009-10 through 2014-15, several states, including large states like California and Florida, experienced both a one-year double-digit increase and a double-digit decrease in funding (e.g. California, Florida). Other states avoided such fluctuations (e.g. New Jersey, Maine). Changes in overall funding are behind the most extreme changes in funding per student.

                <h3>Funding per FTE student since 2000-01, in 2015 Dollars</h3>
                <p>An overall steep decline of t in state funding per FTE student between 2000-01 and 2013-14 resulted from a large increase in enrollment) combined with a small decline in total funding (in inflation-adjusted dollars). This overall trend, however, conceals considerable variation across states, with increases of over 30 percent (e.g. North Dakota, Wyoming) to declines of over 50 percent (e.g. Oregon, Pennsylvania, Michigan).</p>
                <p>As with total funding, per-student funding hit its low point for most states in 2011-12. Between 2011-12 and 2013-14, funding per student recovered some of the ground it lost during the recession, increasing by 6 percent nationwide. In some states, the recovery has been dramatic (Illinois, North Dakota), while in others funding per student has continued to fall (e.g. Louisiana, Rhode Island).</p>
